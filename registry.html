                  <p>Did you know that expecting families spend, on average, 40 hours putting together their baby registries? It’s true! Researching every item, comparing products, and figuring out what you actually need can be overwhelming—and even with all that effort, it’s easy to overlook essentials or end up with things that aren’t the best fit for your family.</p>
